This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.",
